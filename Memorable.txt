For me, the most memorable part of this class was the time that we demostrated list reversal with people in the front of the room.
I thought it was pretty funny just how awkward it was having a group of strangers awkwardly tapping each other on the shoulder and
asking to switch places.
That being said, the part of this quarter that I will remember the most is the worldwide epidemic that casued classes to all be online.
